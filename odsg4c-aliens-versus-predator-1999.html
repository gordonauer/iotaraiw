Sooo, someone told me recently that I had played A LOT of very varied games, for a very long time, and gave me the idea of making a small list of games I enjoyed by year, which is what I did. It got a bit out of hand.

Monolith's Aliens Versus Predators 2 is not only one of the best movie licensed game, its marine campaign alone is one of the intense FPS games I've ever played. It is shame there is no way to get that game from the digital distribution platforms. However, it is the sequel to the Rebellion's original, the developer famous for the Sniper Elite series. I'm not sure whether Rebellion has a fetish on both Alien and Predator franchises, but they have created three AVP games: 1994 Jaguar game which. It's that time again. Here is a list of around 3,600 books (99% sure they're all still in the collection). I'm down for offers, but buyer pays full shipping from outside Philadelphia. While I'd LOVE to sell full runs (especially if it's an entire series) as a whole, I could be convinced to break some up, or piece out parts of runs (like 1-20 of a 40 issue run or something). Every book is bagged, many are boarded, some are double bagged. They're almost all in good to mint condition.

What is this? - First I read through the chronological list of Predator and early AVP comic books and movies on the xenopedia wiki: . Then I bought/found, read and watched each entry myself. I then spent time considering which comic books should be removed, or their order should be changed if they didn't make sense in the context of the universe. The result is this list. What does it cover? - This list is only 1/3 finished! The following covers

Time for the big list again. Here's the deal. I wanna get rid of these. They've served me well, and hopefully they can serve others well. I don't wanna get shafted, but I'm willing to cut some deals, especially if you want a bunch of stuff. I'm not interested in breaking up complete runs, but I can be persuaded. I'll ship from outside of Philadelphia at a rate of 2.1oz per comic, or flat rate shipping. I'll use the USPS website to try and find the best prices. Most books are in great condition. Need to go holiday shopping for your loved ones? Want to remind your parents how much you appreciate them? Buy some comics that they won't want and then give back to you! I'll ship via regular USPS from the Philadelphia area. I can get you a proper quote from the PO. Let's make a deal! I'm pretty sure everything is still available.

Hello patientgamers! A fair warning : this post is not going to be short, so I invite you to skip over the first few paragraphs if you don't fancy reading too much, or just feel like going straight to the point. There is not going to be a TL;DR. Half a year ago my good old AMD HD6870 died due to my recklessness. I hadn't cleaned my computer (physically) in months and I paid for it. I'm saying it once again, Take care of your machines, PCs or consoles alike! Make sure that you clean. Time to keep slowly unloading books! I can work with reasonable offers, but you have to pay the full shipping cost. I can get an estimate based on the average comic book weight of 2.1oz or so (https://nothingbutcomics.net/2015/03/23/comicsweight/). I prefer to keep longer runs intact, but for the right price, I'll pretty much do anything. Let's make a deal. Please only ask for pictures if you're serious.

Just because I'm bored at work today, I compiled a list of every PC game that scored an 85+ on metacritic for the past 20 years. Obviously this list should be taken with a grain of salt, especially for older games since metacritic didn't even start until 1999 and there weren't nearly as many sites reviewing games back when the internet was still picking up steam. As a disclaimer, I only pulled PC games because those are the ones I'm personally most interested in and the fact that a lot of these. Y'all have seen my list before, but I've added a lot more. Basically, I'm selling everything that isn't Batman from my collection. That's over 3000 comics. I've had a blast collecting for the past 30 years, but I'm tired of lugging them around and I don't have the same attachment to them that I once did. Hopefully they can go to a home where they will be appreciated more than I do these days. I'd like to try and avoid splitting up consecutive runs, but I could be convinced. I'm not looking. You know the drill. big list. somewhat fair deals. the more you buy the better the somewhat fair deal becomes. shipping can be quoted for serious buyers within 3 days. full runs like to stay as a family (but all families can be destroyed for the right price). please don't ask for pictures of a ton of stuff unless you're really serious (it was a pain in the ass that one time when I had to photograph like 100 books and then the dude was like "naaaaw" a few days later).
