I have always felt weird about Pike's easy acquiescence to Vina's desire to stay on Talos IV to enjoy the fantasy of being beatiful -- even moreso since he goes out of his way to say that he agrees with her reasons (not respects, not dissents but feels he must go along with, but _agrees_). Apparently the Discovery writers feel the same way, because the use of cybernetic implants, and especially the cruel fate of Airiam, may put the whole scenario in a different light.

Giant squid were found for centuries, actively influenced legends, and had been decorated in private collections and museums for a very long time. The ancient Greeks actually actively knew of gorillas, which is in fact a Greek word. The idea that these beings were somehow completely unknown until recently doesn’t really add up.

Hello everyone. I know exactly what you're thinking, "Another Adam topic?! Why?!" Well, I wrote a rather long comment on a YouTube video and frankly, I didn't want it to go to waste. So I wanted to give my thoughts in full on Adam. Now I have used similar arguments before, but this is probably the most concise one of those. I enjoyed Adam's character. I joined late to the fandom, only joining up around the start of V6, so I had no nostalgia or headcanon for what I felt Adam was going The Human Menagerie succeeded in appearing both epic and concise at the same time and, while neither album nor single charted, both paved the way for what even cynics knew was an imminent breakthrough. https://random-french-girl.tumblr.com/post/182923342981/almea-catradoraaf-replied-to-your-post-i (https://random-french-girl.tumblr.com/post/182923342981/almea-catradoraaf-replied-to-your-post-i) amp#x200B; I always thought it was perfect for the volume 5 confrontation to be Blake amp Sun vs Adam, and the volume 6 confrontation to be Blake amp Yang vs Adam.

And many of them have to do with precisely the era that Discovery is inhabiting. Why in the world does Spock so visibly smile in "The Cage" (and in footage duplicated in "The Menagerie") when confronted with that weird plant? Why is he so emotional about "the women!"? And -- I mean, come on! -- why is he willing to risk everything for some dude we've. Cockney Rebel The Human Menagerie is popular Free Mp3.
